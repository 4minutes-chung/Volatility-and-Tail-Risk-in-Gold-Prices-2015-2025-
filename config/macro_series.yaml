# Macro data sources used for extending the gold risk analysis project.
# YAML ("YAML Ain't Markup Language") is a plain-text format for structured

# ``series`` list defines one download target for scripts/download_macro_data.py.
# The keys in each block map directly to the SeriesConfig dataclass fields in
# scripts/download_macro_data.py, which builds the appropriate API request and
